'Thanks for downloading my Skin Example v1.0,
'There are probobly a couple of reasons why you did:
'Either you were interested in what this, you 
'Wanted to know how to skin your programs,
'Or you just wanted to learn how to use BitBlt.

'Is this example I made, it's a decent one on
'How to use BitBlt to Skin your apps. The skins
'Aint that great but the main thing to focus on is
'The coding and how it cut's sections of a Bitmap(bmp)
'Using BitBlt and then pastes it into a picturebox.
'When I made this I didn't know much about BitBlt either
'But I got pretty good after making this. So I recommend
'You try something like this from scratch and use my coding
'As a reference...It took me about an hour or more to make this
'Example(10 Skins, Commenting, Perfection) so If I can do this
'And understand it then you can to. I commented "EVERY" line in this
'Example..Declarations to everything below. So enjoy and I hope you
'Learn something as I have.
